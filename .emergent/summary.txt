<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a platform named QuantPayChain. The initial request was to build a Proof of Concept (PoC) to tokenize Real World Assets (RWAs) for various blockchains, compliant with ISO 20022 standards, and linked to real sales.

Through conversation, the requirements were expanded to include:
- An interactive, multi-chain marketplace for a wide range of RWAs.
- High-standard authentication (both social login and custom JWT).
- Real payment integration (Stripe was chosen initially).
- An AI-powered analysis and reporting dashboard compliant with ISO 20022.
- The project should be architected to integrate the user's existing, non-functional Frankenstein project, which includes concepts of post-quantum cryptography and a specific violet/purple brand aesthetic.
- The final stack should be Next.js, FastAPI, and Supabase (PostgreSQL), deployed on Vercel.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
A new, professionally structured monorepo project has been created from scratch and pushed to the user's GitHub repository ().
- **Stack:** Next.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend scaffold), Supabase (PostgreSQL database), Turborepo.
- **Frontend ():** Deployed on Vercel. It now correctly displays the UI with the user's requested purple/violet theme after fixing CSS loading issues.
- **Backend ():** The code structure exists but it is **not yet deployed** or connected to the frontend.
- **Database:** A Supabase project is live. The database schema has been created, and sample data has been inserted via a SQL script provided by the agent.
- **Deployment:** The Next.js frontend is deployed on Vercel and connected to the Supabase database via environment variables.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The user reported that after the successful visual deployment, the dashboard and marketplace pages were displaying static content and were not connected to the database. The agent addressed this by updating the corresponding frontend files (, ) to fetch data from Supabase. It also created a technical report document () and pushed all changes to the user's GitHub repository.
- **Status**: **USER VERIFICATION PENDING**
- **Agent Testing Done**: N (The code was pushed but not tested on the live Vercel deployment).
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual verification by the user. The next agent must instruct the user to check their Vercel dashboard for the automatic redeployment triggered by the latest push. The user then needs to visit the live URL and confirm that the Dashboard and Marketplace pages now show data from Supabase (e.g., the MCB-NYC token).
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Dashboard and Marketplace pages show static data (P0)**
    -   **Description**: The live Vercel site, while visually correct, does not display dynamic data from the Supabase database on the dashboard and marketplace pages.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent updated the data-fetching logic in  and  and pushed the fix to GitHub.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Instruct the user to check Vercel for the latest deployment and verify if the data is now appearing.
        2.  If the issue persists, check the Vercel deployment logs for runtime errors.
        3.  Inspect the browser's developer console on the live site for any network or client-side errors related to Supabase.
        4.  Confirm the Supabase environment variables are correctly configured in the Vercel project settings.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is critical to make the application functional and prove the connection between the frontend and the database, which is a core requirement of the PoC.
    -   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Project Refactoring and Initial Feature Implementation (P0)**
    -   **Description**: The project was completely re-architected into a Next.js/Supabase monorepo. The basic structure is deployed, but core features are missing.
    -   **Where to resume**: After the user verifies that the dynamic data is loading, the agent needs to proceed with implementing the remaining core features.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A functional PoC with the core features requested by the user.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
    -   **Blocked on something**: User verification of the last fix.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **(P0) Deploy FastAPI Backend**: Configure Vercel to deploy the FastAPI backend located in  as serverless functions and connect it to the frontend.
    - **(P1) Implement User Authentication**: Build the complete login/signup flow using Supabase Auth, connecting the frontend UI to the backend logic.
    - **(P2) Implement Create Asset Feature**: Build the forms and API endpoints required for users to tokenize new RWAs.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - Implement real payment integration with Stripe for purchasing tokens.
    - Build the AI-powered analysis features for the dashboard.
    - Develop the ISO 20022 compliant reporting system.
    - Integrate the post-quantum cryptography concepts from the user's original documentation.
    - Add multi-chain support logic.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Recently completed:**
  - Architected and built a new monorepo project from scratch using Next.js, Turborepo, and Supabase.
  - Guided the user (a non-developer) through setting up Supabase, including creating a project, generating a schema, and inserting data.
  - Guided the user through deploying the Next.js frontend to Vercel.
  - Debugged and resolved multiple Vercel build and configuration errors (Root Directory, install commands).
  - Pushed the entire refactored project to the user's new GitHub repository.
  - Fixed a critical CSS issue where styles were not loading on the production deployment.
  - Created architectural and technical documentation (, ).
  - Implemented and pushed a fix for connecting the Dashboard and Marketplace pages to the Supabase backend for data fetching.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All prior issues were related to the initial (now discarded) React/MongoDB application or have been resolved during the Vercel deployment process.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**
The project is a monorepo managed by Turborepo, located in .


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Monorepo:** Turborepo
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
- **Backend:** FastAPI (scaffolded)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Deployment:** Vercel

**key DB schema**
- **users**: {id, email, name, role, ...}
- **rwa_assets**: {id, name, asset_type, description, value_usd, ...}
- **tokens**: {id, asset_id, token_symbol, total_supply, price_per_token, ...}
- **transactions**: {id, buyer_id, token_id, quantity, total_amount, ...}
- **payment_transactions**: {id, session_id, user_id, amount, status, ...}
- **iso_reports**: {id, user_id, report_type, data, ...}

**changes in tech stack**
The project underwent a complete migration from the agent's default **React + FastAPI + MongoDB** stack to a user-requested **Next.js + FastAPI + Supabase (PostgreSQL)** stack to align with the user's existing project and preferences.

**All files**
- : Key file for Vercel deployment configuration. Was modified multiple times to fix build errors.
- : Modified to move Tailwind CSS to  to fix production styling.
- : Defines the entire database schema for Supabase.
- : Recently updated to fetch data from Supabase.
- : Recently updated to fetch data from Supabase.
- : The main layout file for the Next.js application.
- : A guide created for the user.
- : A technical report document created for the user.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The FastAPI backend in  is currently just a scaffold. It needs to be fully implemented with business logic and configured for deployment on Vercel as serverless functions.
- The project's Vercel configuration in  needs to be updated to handle the deployment of both the Next.js app and the FastAPI functions from the same monorepo.

**key api endpoints**
The API endpoints defined in  are placeholders and are not yet functional or deployed.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The user is not a developer.** All instructions, especially for deployment and configuration (Vercel, Supabase), must be extremely simple, clear, and preferably based on GUI interactions (clicks) rather than CLI commands.
- The project has been completely re-architected. Do not refer to the initial agent-created code (React/MongoDB). The source of truth is the  directory, which is synced with the user's GitHub repo.
- The immediate next step is to confirm with the user if the latest push fixed the data-loading issue on the live Vercel site. Vercel should have triggered an automatic redeploy.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Reports the deployed site on Vercel is just plain text, with no styles. Provides the URL.
2.  **Agent:** Identifies missing CSS styles, moves Tailwind to production dependencies, and pushes a fix to GitHub. Asks the user to redeploy.
3.  **User:** Confirms the new deployment is visually correct (se desplego correctamente) but reports that the dashboard is not connected to anything (no conecta a nada).
4.  **Agent:** Acknowledges the dashboard is static, updates the code to fetch data from Supabase, creates a technical report, and pushes all changes to GitHub.
5.  **User:** *No pending messages. The agent has just finished its last action. The next step is waiting for the user to verify the latest deployment.*

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The FastAPI backend () is not deployed or functional.
- **Mocked:** The dashboard and marketplace pages were showing mocked/static data. A fix has been pushed but is pending verification.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
- **Test files created**: None. All testing is manual.
- **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
The user manages their own Supabase and Vercel accounts. The agent pushed the code to the user's GitHub repository using a temporary personal access token provided by the user. No credentials are required for the next agent.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has not yet configured or deployed the FastAPI backend () on Vercel. The current deployment only serves the Next.js frontend. This is a critical upcoming step to make the full application functional.</analysis>
